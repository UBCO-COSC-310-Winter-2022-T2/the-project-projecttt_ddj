Project description

For this project our team will be building an i-clicker clone.
We will build a polling platform that will allow the instructor to interact with the user by posting poll questions on the platform and the user can participate in the poll.
by checking into the active session and submitting their responses. Their response for the active pole will be recorded by the platform and they will receive instant feedback to their responses. The platform will use the observer design pattern to send notification to the instructor of the student responses. The facade design pattern will be used to simplify the interface between the user and the main system. 

Observer design pattern


Facade design pattern

Apart from this, our system should use Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) to ensure our platform is continuously updated to merge new features and fix any bugs. We shall enable automated testing and deploy quickly without errors
