# FINAL DOCUMENTATION


-	What did your team build? Is it feature complete and running?

This website is designed to implement a classroom polling system. It consists of two main components: the iclicker software that is run by the instructor and the iclicker mobile and devices to interact with the instructor. This clicker system enables the instructor to release multiple-choice and short-answer questions and student can submit their answers using their devices which are transmitted to the software. The instructor can grade the results in real time and display them on the devices used by students. The iClicker system also allows the instructor to keep a track of attendance.
To conclude , this website allows for real-time interaction between the student and the instructor which results in interactive discussions and participation.

-	How many of your initial requirements that your team set out to deliver did you deliver (a checklist/table would help to summarize)?
Requirements delivered:
1.	Made a dashboard for the student 
2.	Made a dashboard for the instructor
3.	Login/Create an account page for the student 
4.	Login/Create an account page for the instructor
5.	Student (after logging in) can view their courses
6.	Students can join their courses, and look at their attendance and statistics (performance in the class)
7.	Instructors (after logging in) can view their courses.
8.	Instructors can add new courses
9.	Instructors (after logging in) can start the class




       -  Were you able to deliver everything or are there things missing?

Incomplete feature- Instructors can grade the results, this is one of the features in terms of the instructor that was not completed due to time constraint. it required the implementation of some advanced coding functions and due to the limited time frame and other prior commitments, we faced issues as a team completing this feature with full efficiency.


-	 Did your initial requirements sufficiently capture the details needed for the project?
The initial requirements which were specified by us as a team sufficiently captured the details needed for the project. The requirements specified by us contained functional and non-functional requirements, user requirements and system requirements. The initial requirements specified all the necessary implementations for the system to be running efficiently. 




-	What is the architecture of the system?
I follows a client-server architecture where the client keeps sending a request to the server to get any information. The client send the request to the server using their system and the server responds to the request with the required information. There can be other architectures used for the same as well.



-	What are the key components?
The main key components of a polling system are as follows: client application to send requests to the server for retrieving the required information, server application to send the information to the client, database to store the data needed and the communication protocol to figure out about the communication between the client and the server.




-	 What design patterns did you use in the implementation?

There are various design patterns used for the polling system such as the observer pattern where the clients act as an observer and registers with the server to receive updates and the singleton pattern where it es ensured that there is only one instance of the server application which will be running at any given time.




-	 How many tasks are left in the backlog?

There is just one task which is in backlog and that is to add the feature of grading the results by the instructor. This feature was in progress during milestone 4 but it required some advanced coding implementation for it to run efficiently.

-    	How did your project management work for the team?  What was the hardest thing and what would you do the same/differently the next time you plan to complete a project like this? 
Throughout the six milestones of this project our team followed the agile project development approach. This approach was iterative and flexible and allowed our team to manage our goals in an effective manner. We divided our goals into sprints and organized the tasks in each sprint. We held meetings and updated our Kanban board accordingly. 
The hardest thing was writing the codes for some of the features in the given time constraint. Next time if we plan a project like this, we will try to ensure that the features that we are trying to implement are possible to be implemented in the given time constraint. However, we will still follow the agile approach to manage our project as we found it immensely helpful.

-      Do you feel that your initial requirements were sufficiently detailed for this project?  Which requirements did you miss or overlook?

Yes, most of the requirements were detailed however,  we overlooked one or two requirements that we added in the later stages and updated our repository with them likewise.

-      What did you miss in your initial planning for the project (beyond just the requirements)

Our sequence and class diagrams were not as detailed as they should have been. If we had not missed listing all the features in our diagrams, our project development would have been more focused with clearler defined goals.

-	What process did you use (ie Scrum, Kanabn..), how was it managed, and what was observed? 

We maintained a Kanban board and presented our milestones' summary using an agile dashboard. We maintained a list of “To Do”, “Done” and “ In progress”. We arranged our tasks into weekly sprints and the tasks that were not finished were automatically shifted to the backlogs and picked up in the next sprint. Our Kanban board was accessible to all the three members and actively used throughout the milestones. It helped us to generate reports and helped us to single out the tasks that needed more attention. It gave us an idea of our speed of development and a clear vision of our goals and check the status of our project.

-	As a team, did you encounter issues with different team members developing with different IDEs?  In the future, would the team change anything in regard to the uniformity of development environments?

	Yes, we encountered issues such as different members working with different IDEs however, we managed to collaborate and got to experience working with IDEs outside our comfort zone. We gained more knowledge from each other and learned working with new environments.
       
 -     If you were to estimate the efforts required for this project again, what would you consider?  (Really I am asking the team to reflect on the difference between what you thought it would take to complete the project vs what it actually took to deliver it).   

This project required good coding and software development knowledge. We applied the software development methods we learnt throughout the course. However, this project required more regularity and collaboration than we expected.

- What did your team do that you feel is unique or something that the team is especially proud of (was there a big learning moment that the team had in terms of gaining knowledge of a new concept/process that was implemented).

Some members of our team were not familiar with php however through this project we were able to get more experience and when were able to create our login page using php it was a big moment for us as a team.
